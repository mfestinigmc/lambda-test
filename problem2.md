# Problem 2: Pentagon Dots

Have the function **PentagonalNumber** receive a num which will be a positive integer and determine how many dots exist in a pentagonal shape around a center dot on the Nth iteration. For example, in the image below you can see that on the first iteration there is only a single dot, on the second iteration there are 6 dots, on the third there are 16 dots, and on the fourth there are 31 dots.

Your program should console.log the number of dots that exist in the whole pentagon on the **Nth iteration**.

Sample Test Cases

```
event: {num:2}

desired output 6
```


```
event: {num:5}

desired output 51
```
